# FWD_AutomationProject_UsingPOM
This project is an ecommerce Selenium Webdriver package that has some extra features for your automation tests.
 
It can register multiple users, add an item to the cart, and complete the purchase process.
 
It uses selenium webdriver, java, TestNG and pom in this project. You just need to use your normal send-keys, click … etc and the driver will locate the element, move to it with fluent wait and highlight it.
 
You have many options to set up the driver, such as specifying the driver name, or using the configuration property file, or leaving it blank to launch Chrome by default.
 
There are more features than what I showed in the video, this is just a preview. it’s still under development.
 
This is my trial run with it. I hope you enjoy it
